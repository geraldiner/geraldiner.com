  - sectionTitle: '2 Truths, 1 Lie'
    facts:
      - fact: My last name means “joy” or “happiness”
        details: |
          From the [Filipino language of Ilocano](https://toidp.com/search/?s=ragsak\&l=ilo), which is what my family speaks.
        isTrue: true
      - fact: I’m a middle child with 3 brothers and 6 sisters
        details: |
          I am a middle child, but I only have 1 older brother and 1 younger sister. My mom is the one with 3 brothers and 6 sisters, and she’s the oldest. I have 20+ first cousins on that side of the family alone.
      - fact: I crocheted my own wedding dress
        details: |
          Even when I first started trying on dresses, I already felt an inkling that I was going to do it. After only 1 year of crocheting for fun, [I completed my dress](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOWBfp3jqaw/?img_index=4) in about 2 months (after at least 5 restarts) with 4 months to spare. It was freehanded (no pattern), combining techniques from different dresses I liked.
