# My Website

Usually I use my website as a guinea pig for new technologies I'm learning. But now I think it's just too much work to keep up.

Plus, I showcase most of my other work either in [GitHub](https://github.com/geraldiner) (software engineering, web development) or on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/geraldinedesu) (crochet), so I'm treating this more as a waypoint.

There's a couple blurbs about all the things I do, and if you're interested, you'll be directed to where you can learn more.

This is inspired by http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/ and https://mayanwolfe.com/. The animated gradient borders with CSS is by [Julien Thibeaut](https://ibelick.com/blog/create-animated-gradient-borders-with-css).
