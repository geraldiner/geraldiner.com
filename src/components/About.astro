    <p>
      Oh, hi! Iâ€™m Geraldine! I enjoy building tools that make learning and
      everyday life a little easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a background in UX design and teaching, empathy, clarity, and
      accessibility shape everything I build. My favorite projects are
      mission-driven, combining usability with thoughtful design.
    </p>
    <p>
      In free time, I enjoy playing video games, crocheting, and all things that
      spark joy. ðŸ’–
